# Fraud-Detection
Identify fraud customers using SOM and ANN. The customers provide information for getting a credit card and we need to identify the fraud customers. The SOM is used to identify outlying customers and then they predict who are fraud. The ANN is then used on the selected customers to get the probablity that they are a fraud.
